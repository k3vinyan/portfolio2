            <p>Hello! I am a web developer living in San Jose, California.  I am interested in creating beautiful web applications and solving challenging problems. On the journey, I have established a good foundation with full stack development but generally found myself fully immerse and passion with front-end development. On my free time I am always looking to improve myself with new technologies and projects.</p>
